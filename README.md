# ABOUT

This repository contains my first attempt at creating a personal website for a Udacity academic project using elements from both HTML and CSS. Its layout is responsive for most screen sizes, and runs smoothly. (Tested in Chrome and Firefox)

## How to Run

To run the code, simply double-click the `index.html` file inside the main folder, and it should show a preview automatically inside your default browser.

Or alternatively:

* Right Click `index.html`
* Select "Open With"
* Choose your preferred Internet Browser
